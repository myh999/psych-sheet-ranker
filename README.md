# Psych Sheet Ranker

The Psych Sheet Ranker is a PDF parser that analyzes psych sheets and predicts team rankings. This is especially useful in championship swimming competitions where there is an emphasis on points scored by teams. It uses OpenCV to determine the structure of the PDF and Tesseract to extract text.

Although the base functionality is implemented, this is still a work in progress with many more improvements to be made.
